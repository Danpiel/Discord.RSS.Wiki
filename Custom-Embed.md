In case you don't know what an Embed is, its those fancy Discord messages with a box and text inside it - something that can't be sent via regular messaging. Discord automatically creates an embed for links, such as the one below:

and bots can create their own:

An embed can normally contain [many items](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/84319995256905728/252292324967710721/embed.png), however for the sake of simplicity I have left out several embed options simply because it is most likely too confusing/has no need for so many options. The embed properties that can be customized for a feed are:


|Property|Description|
|-----|-----|
|Color|Must be in [integer format](https://www.shodor.org/stella2java/rgbint.html).|
|Author Title|The text at the top of the embed.|
|Message|The main message of the embed.|
|Footer Text|The small text at the bottom of the embed.|
|Thumbnail URL|A picture to be shown on the right side of the embed.|
|URL|The URL clicking on the Author Title will lead to.|
|Author Avatar URL|The small icon to the left of the Author Title. This will only be shown if Author Title is set.|

**Adding an embed will override the embed that Discord normally sends with links (see first image)**
