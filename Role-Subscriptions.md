Subscriptions are basically mentions for users who want to be notified when a new article for a feed has arrived. They make the use of roles by mentioning roles, since mentioning individuals is unreasonable especially for massive servers. There are two types of subscriptions: Global and Filtered. 

Global mentions subscribed roles on every new article. 

Filtered mentions subscribed roles on custom-defined filters specific to that role.

For the role mentions to show up on messages, the tag `{subscriptions}` must be used.


**Roles that are subscribed must be able to be mentioned by everyone - this is handled in role settings.**
