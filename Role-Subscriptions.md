Subscriptions are basically mentions for users who want to be notified when a new article for a feed has arrived. They make the use of roles by mentioning roles, since mentioning individuals is unreasonable especially for massive servers. There are two types of subscriptions: Global and Filtered. Global mentions subscribed roles on every new article, while filtered mentions subscribed roles on custom-defined filters specific to that role.
